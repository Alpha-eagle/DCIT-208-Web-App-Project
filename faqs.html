      <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
      <h2>Ordering and Payment</h2>
      <h3>When will my credit card be charged?</h3>
      <p>You will receive an email confirmation, listing products ordered, total costs and contact info, as well as shipment confirmation.
         At that time your credit card will be charged. However, we will allocate all funds from your credit card account at the time you submit your order. If a debit card is used the amount will not be available for other uses.</p>
      <h3>Will my order be checked for accuracy?</h3>
      <p>All online orders are verified by our team of experts for proper vehicle fitments and appropriate product selection. You will be contacted if any discrepancy is found to ensure complete and accurate shipment of your purchase.</p>
      
      <h3>What payment options does Online Tire Outlet offer?</h3>
      <p>MasterCard, VISA, Discover, American Express, PayPal and PayPal Credit are acceptable forms of payment for online orders. We also accept payment by Western Union.</p>
      
      <h2>Tire Information</h2>
      <h3>I don't know my tire size. What should I do?</h3>
      <p>Use Our Easy To Use Fitment Guide - Shop for Tires by Vehicle.

        Only tires specifically for the vehicle selected will be shown in search results. From there you can select an Original Equipment replacement or a performance upgrade per the results shown. You can refine your search by selecting certain criteria from various categories. For example, if you prefer a certain brand or require a specific performance category, only those search results will be shown. From there you can read complete product descriptions, test results, tire specs, etc.
        
        Or, feel free to <a href="contact.html">contact us</a>  with any questions or concerns.</p>
      <h3>What does speed rating mean and what is correct for my vehicle?</h3>
      <p>In Germany, some highways do not have speed limits and high-speed driving is permitted. Speed ratings were established to match the speed capability of tires with the top speed capability of the vehicles to which they are applied. For example, an R-speed rated tire is designed for maximum speeds of 106 mph. You can select the rating(s) based on your vehicle and intended use. When you choose "recommended" you will see the speed rating(s) appropriate for your vehicle. Numbers in parentheses indicate quantity of tires available and do not include winter or competition tire counts that are below your vehicle's recommended speed rating.</p>
      <h3>What is the proper air pressure for my tires?</h3>  
      <p>Proper tire air pressure is determined by the vehicle manufacturers and is set to best fine-tune a tire's capabilities to their specific vehicle make and model. The vehicle manufacturer's pressure recommendation can be found on the vehicle's tire information placard label, as well as in the vehicle owner's manual.</p>
      
      <h3>How do you know what tire fits my vehicle?</h3>
      <p>Original Equipment tire sizes shown in search results for particular vehicles are determined based on the best information currently available to us from vehicle manufacturers and from manual inspection of new vehicles as they are released. Many vehicles have optional trim levels/packages that include different tire sizes. </p>
      <p>Since variations based on options or vehicle manufacturer changes may determine the Original Equipment tire size on your vehicle, always verify that the size you are purchasing matches the tire size for your vehicle (usually found in the door jamb, glove box lid or gas cap door) or in the Owner's Manual.</p>
      <p>If you are unsure what size is installed on your vehicle, please confirm the size as listed on the tire sidewall before placing your order.

        The Optional Tire Sizes featuring different rim diameters we list for many vehicles are based on over 40 years of experience we have with plus size wheel and tire combinations. However, it is important to note that these optional tire sizes are based on vehicle specific wheel sizes/offsets offered by Online Tire Outlet.</p>
      
        <h2>Shipping and Warranties</h2>
      <h3>Will I need to sign for my order when it is delivered?</h3>
      <p>In most cases delivery is at the discretion of the carrier and signature is not required, although there are some types of addresses that will require a signature.</p>
      <p>If you would like to ensure your item is left with a signature, please contact the carrier and request that they leave the item with a signature. They will normally ask that you sign an agreement in advance taking responsibility for the item. Please also remember that we can ship your tires to an eligible UPS center.</p>
      <h3>Where can I find warranty information on merchandise I ordered?</h3>
      <p>Detailed tire warranty information complete with downloadable PDF of warranty brochure (where available) is found on every tire's detail page.</p>
       <h3>What will my shipping charges be?</h3>
       <p>Shipping charges as well as delivery times can be seen once you enter your ZIP/Postal Code and view product search results or detailed product pages on the site.</p>
       <h3>What is your return policy?</h3>    
       <p>We will accept returns within 30 days of delivery. Only unused products that have not been driven on and are still in original packaging are eligible for return. Credit amount will be calculated as follows: TIRES: Credit minus all freight charges incurred plus a 10% restocking fee. SPECIAL ORDER ITEMS: Special order items are not returnable. Orders shipped via Ontrac, or UPS are charged freight both ways on refused shipments. Credits will be issued to the credit card used on the order. If payment received was cash or check, we will refund by check to the billing address.</p>
       <p>Merchandise covered by a manufacturer's warranty is sold with the warranty by the manufacturer extended to the purchaser. We will be happy to assist in obtaining fulfillment of a manufacturer's warranty.</p>
