        <h3>I don't know my tire size. What should I do?</h3>
        <p>Use Our Easy To Use Fitment Guide - Shop for Tires by Vehicle.</p>

        <h2>Shipping and Warranties</h2>
        <h3>Will I need to sign for my order when it is delivered?</h3>
        <p>In most cases delivery is at the discretion of the carrier and signature is not required, although there are some types of addresses that will require a signature.</p>
        <p>If you would like to ensure your item is left with a signature, please contact the carrier and request that they leave the item with a signature. They will normally ask that you sign an agreement in advance taking responsibility for the item. Please also remember that we can ship your tires to an eligible UPS center.</p>
