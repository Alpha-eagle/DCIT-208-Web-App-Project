        <h1>WARRANTY</h1>
        <h2>Warranty Information</h2>
        <p class="lead">At Westrock Enterprise, we stand behind the quality of our tires. We offer a comprehensive warranty program that covers our tires for a certain period of time or mileage, whichever comes first.</p>

          <div class="warranty-item">
            <h3>Standard Warranty</h3>
            <p>A warranty is a manufacturer's assurance of quality that defines the period of time that they will repair or replace products that show signs of defects due to materials or workmanship.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="warranty-item">
            <h3>Tread/Mileage Warranties</h3>
            <p>Treadlife/mileage warranties are a popular marketing tool used to help position tires competitively in the marketplace by identifying their potential longevity.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="warranty-item">
            <h3>Uniformity Warranty</h3>
            <p>Even though tires are built to tight tolerances, there is bound to be some unavoidable tolerances during the manufacturing process.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="warranty-item">
            <h3>Manufacturer Road Hazard Coverage</h3>
            <p>While road hazard injuries (cuts, punctures, snags and bruises) or impact damage caused by potholes, curbs or other objects in the road are an undesirable part of driving, the tire damage they inflict is not within the control of the tire manufacturer and is not typically covered by their limited tire warranties.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <h2>Warranty Duration</h2>
        <p>Each manufacturer specifies the duration of their tires' limited warranty in months or years from the date of purchase.</p>
        <h2>Warranty Claims</h2>
